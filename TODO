Combat
    - Single letters
    - Hotkeys! (1234 etc)
    - Schedule actions for the next tick

Conversations
    - Modal
    - Mutes surroundings (?)
    - Broadcasts when engaged / disengaged
    - Should be able to leave at any time, Skyrim-style

Worlds
    - Run multiple copies of the world?
    - Players should be able to migrate their entities and owned stuff then
        - Or maybe a character is permanently linked to a world?

Test items
    - A key that opens a door
    - A keycard bound to a particular owner
    - A bomb that, when used, counts down to 0 and explodes, damaging nearby stuff
    - Signs, books, walls you can write on/in

Modal interactions
    - Explore mode: arbitrary commands
    - Conversation mode: preset convo options
    - Combat mode: scheduler based
    - Shop mode?

Instances
    - Copies of rooms, NPCs can be created for parties
    - Have a function that creates a list of entities and an instance start room
    - Store the entities in a redis list and tear them down when the party leaves / wins

Flags
    - is_dark (would this be better as a behavior?)
    - is_open (for containers)
    - is_closable "
    - is_lockable "
    - is_flexible (volume is sum of volume of contained objects)
    - is_visible (for stuff like spawners)
    - is_writable

Scaling
    - Every entity has a "zone ID"
    - One ticker per zone
        - Runticker uses multiprocessing to create workers
    - Entities that tick must register with the per-zone tick set

Stuff to think about
    - names and capitalization
    - chairs, beds, vehicles(?)
    - stacks of objects / inventory management / gold
    - equipment
    - holding items
        - inventory is a closed container
        - held items go in an open container
    - change the frontend to purge old messages
    - need a room.unlink() for moving rooms

Frontend improvements
    - Purge old messages
    - Command history
