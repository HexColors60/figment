Refactoring
    - Get rid of as much global state as you can
    - current usage of entity.perform assumes the entity is in explore mode
        - need a good way to check the mode of entities

General
    - In Inform 7, there are a few built-in assertion verbs
        - to be, to have, to carry, to wear, to contain, and to support
        - these, or something like them, should be in figment core

    ! An exit is an entity, not a property
        - It can be closed, locked, relinked, removed
        - On attach, it should add itself to indexes in linked rooms
            - Should update these indexes on unlink / relink
        - Where should "go" logic live? On Door?
            - Should Positioned be renamed to Container?

    - Disambiguation (again)

Combat
    - Single letters
    - Hotkeys! (1234 etc)
    - Schedule actions for the next tick

Conversations
    - Modal
    - Mutes surroundings (?)
    - Broadcasts when engaged / disengaged
    - Should be able to leave at any time, Skyrim-style

Test items
    - A key that opens a door
    - A keycard bound to a particular owner
    - A bomb that, when used, counts down to 0 and explodes, damaging nearby stuff
    - Signs, books, walls you can write on/in

Modal interactions
    - Action mode: arbitrary commands
    - Disambiguation mode
    - Conversation mode: preset convo options
    - Combat mode: scheduler based
        - or, mostly turn based with 20 sec forfeit?
    - Shop mode?

Instances
    - Copies of rooms, NPCs can be created for parties

Stuff to think about
    - names and capitalization
    - chairs, beds, vehicles(?)
    - stacks of objects / inventory management / gold
    - equipment
    - holding items
        - inventory is a closed container
        - held items go in an open container
        - "a box, holding: ..."
    - doors

Examples
    - Add an example that uses continuous coordinates for entity position
    - Add an example that's not very MUD-like (a turn-based game?)
