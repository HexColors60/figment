1.0 blockers: engine
    - entity messages should be JSON, not text
        - Subsumes "client hints"; they're the same thing
        - Allows client to control rendering
            - Enables color based on type, sounds, images
        - Message structure defined by developers
            - Enables inline colors
        - Have to remove `figment listen` and `figment prompt`
            - one, they have to be run on the same host as the world :\
            - two, `listen` can't make assumptions about message format
    - remove the last vestiges of global state (are there any?)
    - remove reference cycles where possible
    - entity lifecycle hooks (?)
        - I have a reference to this entity, but it was destroyed
        - cannot be prevented, but can be reacted to
        - Referenced component? alternative to lifecycle hooks?
            - when component wants to reference entity, attach Referenced to it?
            - on detach, call other components' funcs with arbitrary args?
    - fix things that are clunky
        - managing __init__.py / magical component registration
            - manually register components with the zone on startup
            - does this mean the end of `figment run`?
        - well-known entities
            - need a way to query for entities (by component?)
            - indexed = True: Component class attribute?
                - overlaps with "ticking" somewhat...
        - DisambiguationMode and unique_selection
            - Should DisambiguationMode be named ChoiceMode?

1.0 blockers: examples
    - Continue dogfooding to find parts of API that suck
        - current usage of entity.perform assumes the entity is in ActionMode
            - engine: need an API for checking the mode of entities
    - drop_from?
    - put_from_in??
    - Weapons and equipment (wield / wear)
    - Conversations
    - Combat
    - Quests
    - Simple in-game editing tools

1.0 blockers: tests
    - Existing tests are too simple/limited
    - Worlds need their own tests

1.0 blockers: docs
    - Use Sphinx, autodoc, possibly napoleon
    - Simple theme and logo :)
        - Sunshiney font is nice (lowercase f)
    - Walk through building a simple world (TDD?)
    - Writing tests for your world
    - How to scale Figment
    - Running a frontend (registration, etc.)
    - Advanced topics
        - Rich message data
        - Multiple zones

Crazy ideas for later versions
    - Entity 'porting (importing, transporting, teleporting)
        - copying a set of entities from one zone to another
        - any referenced entities must be contained in the set
        - all references must be updated by asking the zone for new IDs
        - really, this is the same thing as cloning an entity
        - how do we know what data is an entity reference?
    - Register/unregister components and modes at runtime
    - Script components (Lua?)
    - Graphical example

Example: The World Foundry
    - Antechamber
        - Newbie / private zone
        - Created when you register
        - Destroyed when you leave
        - One-way exit to the foundry
        - Some basic items to pick up, examine
            - chaos key (to your apartment)
            - loopback (use to return to the foundry)
            - journal (you can write in it)
            - misc junk, boxes, bags
        - only opens up when you've picked up the important quest items
    - The World Foundry
        - A large institution devoted to the study of creating worlds
        - Exhibits / classrooms / workshops
    - The Inventorium
        - Researches items / weapons / equipment
        - Lots of little usable gadgets
    - The Conversatory
        - NPCs you can talk to
        - Shopkeepers
        - The Herald (an NPC who periodically cries out new topics of discussion)
    - The Library
        - Readable books / documentation
        - Speaking out loud is forbidden (can only whisper to other people)
    - The Sparring Grounds
        - Train against inanimate objects, monsters, and other players
        - Test weapons and spells
    - Apeiron Apartments
        - Create a personal pocket universe
        - Worldbuilding commands are enabled for you within your space

Notes and ideas
    - In Inform 7, there are a few built-in assertion verbs
        - to be, to have, to carry, to wear, to contain, and to support
        - consider including these in examples

        - Single letters
        - Schedule actions for the next tick (?)
    - Conversations
        - Modal
        - Mutes surroundings (?)
        - Broadcasts when engaged / disengaged (?)
        - Should be able to leave at any time, Skyrim-style
    - Test items
        - A key that opens a door
        - A keycard bound to a particular owner
        - A bomb that, when used, counts down to 0 and explodes, damaging nearby stuff
        - Signs, books, walls you can write on/in
    - Modes
        - Action mode: arbitrary commands
        - Disambiguation mode (?)
        - Conversation mode: preset convo options
        - Combat mode: scheduler based
            - or, mostly turn based with 20 sec forfeit?
