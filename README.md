# Figment

Figment is an experimental engine with a component-based entity system that was
built to scratch an intellectual itch. Inspired by text-based object
manipulation environments like text adventure games and
[SHRDLU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHRDLU), the goal is to create a virtual
world populated by objects that can interact with each other in interesting and
unexpected ways.

It's still in the weekend-project state, so don't go using it for anything
remotely critical -- but it *is* complete enough to be mildly amusing. :)

## Planned features

* Autonomous entities
* Wearable/equippable entities
* Other frontends (web-based? graphical?)
* Persistence
* Multiplayer support (maybe)
* Sound-emitting entities (with realistic inverse-square falloff)
* Better position system, maybe room-oriented / MUD-style
